hi everyone in this video i'm going to show us um the function submax in numpy and pytorch in google collab now the submap function by definition is that it's gonna if you have a list of number let's say one two three four five for example right there right you're gonna take the exponent of each one of the uh those numbers and it's gonna divide that with the uh the sum of the total exponent of those numbers so let's say right if you have one two three four five it's gonna take the exponent of one x one of two so on and two five right and then it could have sum that on those exponent and then the submark of one for example or the first number is just the exponent of that first number which is one of the situation and and divided by the the sum of the total exponent uh the sum of all of the exponent in the list right there okay and you can see right here the the sub mass function kind of relied i mean is relying on the natural exponent e to the x right here and if you take a look at the graph of e to the x you can see some property of the exponent

the exponent uh function right here you notice that it's increased pretty quickly um to infinitive you can see right here right you go to two three four five sorry start zooming up uh pretty quickly and that it never uh it's only a positive function it's never um did below zero so you can see right here if you go to minus two minus three or something like that the number getting smaller and smaller but it doesn't dip below zero so it how i got this graph is that i i create a linear um space using linear space i create um a list of 100 number even evenly spaced between -2 and 2 right here and then for each one of those the number and the list i calculate the exponent e to the x using numpy right here and i plot it with x with x on the x-axis right here from this and then y is the exponent right here you can see right there right and by the way this special syntax right here is latex that can give you a special kind of character creating a printing special character formula is math right there make it look a little bit better so if you want you can find out more about latex how to print latex or formula in colab it basically begin with um a money symbol and end with the money symbol right here so um so the submarine function has a definition of the sub-max function and it depends on the natural exponent and by the way e is 2.71 a

dot dot so then so on right here okay

now i can give you an example of calculating the sub max for uh a list of number right here three four seven for example so if z is equal to three four seven and the way to do that is that we gotta compute the expo exponent for each of the number in the list right here which is 3 e to the 3 e to the 4 and e to the 7 and we start out in the vari variable numerator and after that we do the sum of the numerator you can see right here a sum of the numerator in this situation right here which is the exponent of the number and the list and then the sigma which is the sub max is the numerator divided by the denominator and you can see right here right so if you have three four seven the six bars uh or the submax uh calculation of this not these numbers are this this and this and then you see that it'll add up to be about uh one right here it adds up to be one right here uh giving giving given text some grounding up right number and collab and pi time now the interpretation of sub mac is that uh you can think of this as converting the list of number into some sort of probability you see right here right because um the sum of the subtract is going to equal to 1 and each one of those number subtract is going to be between 0 and 1. so you can think of that as a probability for example in deep learning to classify this as a dot this is a cat and this is for example uh above for example right here right so you can do you can use that and think of that as one interpretation so sub mac basically converting a list number into some sort of probability distribution that we can interpret in a particular situation for example image classification okay and then here is the another example of the sub map function i create a random list of integer from -10 low about to up about 10 and the size is 15 right here and again right here i'm just manually computing the exponent of each of this of the number and the list that i store in the variable z and then for the denominator i just sum up all of those exponent values right here okay and the sigma or the sub max is uh the numerator divided by the numerator denominator right here and then we can plot the sub match function um on using math.lip i imported mat.lip right here see and then here i plot it it can give us the x label z i can give it a y label sigma right here uh the spatial character using latex right there and then for the scale right here i can well i can plot it using the regular uh like logarithmic right here now let's look at this right here right if i do it uh regularly i'm combining itself so that it wouldn't run this line right here call that you see that

here is the um the blood and regular uh regular blood it's a regular scale um so the in this interpretation right here the number nine for example right here right would have a higher probability than number seven for example and all of these the uh would add up or the sigma over here would add up to be equal to b one right there right and then if you plot it on the logarithmic scale for example right here okay so scale is like right there you notice that essentially in the logarithmic scale it's just a linear transformation of the original number into the space right here the sub max

sub max right here okay now we can also do this in the in pi torch right there right but it's a bit different uh we have to instantiate an object using the sub-mass class right here from the uh neural network and we are import that the uh dot dot n s n n right here that library so

and then we pass the data the same data uh the same data right here z right here to uh send data z right here into this um uh sub object right here and then it's going to calculate the sigma first and we expect the sigma to be the same you can see right here right when we plot the normal blood the sigma versus the z value you notice that it is essentially the same blood at the one previously when we're using a numpy instead of a pie touch right there okay and by the way for the math for the plotting right there right we can specify the color for example the color of the dot and then the type give me the shape of the dot right so if i change it to x and then if i change it to k for example i think that's black right there let me run that again right there right so you notice that you change it to x and then the value is black right there so this right here is an example of how to calculate the sub map function it has its utility and deep learning hope you enjoy this tutorial please share like
