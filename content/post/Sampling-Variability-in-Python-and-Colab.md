hi everyone in this video i'm going to be i'm going to talk about the sampling variability uh as it applied to statistics or in deep learning for example right here now uh sampling variety a lot of time when we try to measure a parameter for a population let's for example the way the age or the high of a population there's no way we can take the entire population and average the and measure and take the average of that so a lot of time we have to sample a population let's say for example our population of a million we might have to do sample of a thousand and get the average of that right there but if you do the sampling like that right there the result from a single sample like that can be untrustworthy or unpredictable compared to the population parameter for example the average age of the entire population so the measurement or sample may be untrustworthy estimate of a characteristic of population and the reason why there's viability in sampling is because for example we may have measurement noise we may have natural variation we may have natural randomness or system complexity for example so one way we can take into account of the sampling variability is to do a lot of sample because when we do a lot a lot a lot more sample we can use the laws of large number to estimate the population mean so basically what it means is that if you take a lot of samples like that right there and you take the average of that sample then that average right there is going to approach the population average for that particular parameter so if you take a look at this example right here right i have a 30 random numbers between 1 and 100 this right here could could be the age of the population for example right here right and of course right we're going to import numpy and we can import mat.lip to plot the result later

so if you take a look right here right i take the length of the population right here and here i calculate the population mean using the np.mean method right here and then here i'm going to sample a population out of a size of seven so i'm going to take seven a random number out of this population right here and i'm going to put in this variable sample right here and then i'm gonna take the mean use numpy dot mean method to take the mean of the sample right here and i'm gonna print out the population mean and assemble mean and you can see right here right um it there's a there's a little bit of difference between the sample mean and the sample population mean and sample mean

so if i run it again one more time for example right here right you have a different result uh run one more time you have different result but you see that there's a difference between the sample mean and population mean now what happened if we run this again this process again but do it for a thousand times so in here i have the i create array of sample mean of a thousand right here element and then for each element right there i'm gonna go through each one of them take a random sample i can do five for example in this situation right here okay and i can um and then i would take the the mean of that sample i store that into the array right here and so just come on doing that until a thousand right at the end i'm gonna take the mean the average of the sample mean right here and then you see that it's kind of approximately close to the population mean right here okay and then what i did what i did right here is i just create a histogram and i plot the i plot the population mean at the straight line right here so that you can see um and then in here for example you can vary the number of runs you can do like instead of a thousand you can do ten thousand and then instead of five right here i i can do seventeen for example so run it again and you see and you see that the sample mean and the population mean approach approaching uh approximate each other right there so basically the law basically the law of large number is that as a number of identically distributed randomly generated variable increases their sample mean the average approach is their theoretical mean so basically what it means is that if you increase the number of samples right here instead of doing just one sample run you do like thousand ten thousand sample run and then for each of those sample runs you take out and approximate the um uh example of a population so instead of doing on 30 you do 17 right here or do five and then when you do large numbering up you know the two average tend to uh approach each other right here okay so uh this is right here it's just a simple overview of sample verbally that is used a lot in statistics and deep learning i hope you enjoy and learn from this video if you like it please give it a thumb up give it a like comment and

thank you and have a good day
