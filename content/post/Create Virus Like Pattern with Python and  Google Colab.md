In this tutorial I am going to show you how to draw a virus like pattern on um google colab. The first thing we need to do in order to draw the virus like pattern in collab is to import collabturtle the command !pip install collabTurtle. When that runs and installs successfully it will give you a successfully installed message

Next you will import the turtle into your collab notebook with the line from ColabTurtle.Turtle import *.  Then you can initialize a turtle now the window right with a canvas size. In my example, chose 655 650, but you can specify a bigger canvas if you wish. You can also specify the initial speed with tells Turtle how fast it's drawing. I chose the speed of 10, but you can go slower number 5 or faster with 15 for example. You can specify the background colar and the draw color. In my Colab notebook, it's black background and green draw color. The white loop is just going to go repeat the codes inside until the condition is not met anymore. In this case, the while loop repeats until the counting number is less than -200.  Left in colabTurtle rotate the drawing pointer by a certain angle. By default, the angle measurement is in degree, but you can also change it to radian. Forward just tell turtle how pixel to move in the current direction.

Below is the Colab notebook and video explantion of this exercise

I also made a YouTube video discussing the same examples of the transpose operation in Google Colab: {{< youtube RhYefUqvWT0 >}}
