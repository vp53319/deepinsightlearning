Hi everyone in this video i'm going to show us how to do matrix multiplication in using numpy and pytorch in python and in google collab now the matrix multiplication is a more informal way of doing the dot product the one requirement is that the column of the first matrix and the row of the second matrix has to be the same so like for example if you have a three by two matrix which is three row and two column of the first one and you know and you multiply that with a two by three matrix which is two row and three columns that's allowable and your your resulting matrix is three by three if you have like for example three by two times three by two that would not work because um uh the two and three does not uh match does not equal to one another now if you take a look at the notebook right here you see that the first thing i'll do as always import numpy and the pi touch library or touch library right here in the second

cell right here i'm creating um a three by two matrix uh using the integer random integers of uh of the numpy library the random integer method right here right here what it does right here is that it'll pick a random number between one and ten you can specify the lower and upper and then you can specify the shape that you want the matrix to be in the situation it's three by two the second example is also from one to ten but two by three and the third one is three by two and i i put this result into variable x y and z matrix x mixing y and matrix c and i printed out right here x y and z as you can see now if you run this thing again every time you run it it's going to give you a different number because it's going to draw randomly the number between 1 and 10 and put it here okay so here's matrix x matrix y and matrix z you can see right here is uh three rows three rows two columns right this one is two row and three column and the third one the z1 is similar to the x which is three rows and two columns three by two so to multiply um to multiply do matrix multiplication in numpy you have this function map mlu which which is a strong notation for matrix multiplication and this one right here i'm doing x and y uh the order the is matter in this situation if i do y and x you know if i will give an error right here okay so if i do matrix multiplication x and y um it's going to give us the result right here and basically what it does that it's going to go do a dot product of rows and columns so for example if you take a look at this one right here right number 24 which is the first row and second column so what happened is that we'll take the first row first row is of x which is 5 9 right here and the second column is 3 and 1 right here so if you do the dot product of that this right here is 15 3 times 5 five time two is fifteen and nine times one is nine right and nine plus fifteen is twenty-four see right there all right now another example you can see is let's say let's do the uh second row and third column so what what what you would do is that you take the second row of the the second row of the first vector x right here one and three and then the third column is two and three so two times two is 2 3 times 3 is 9 right and add them together as a dot product is 11 and you do it element by you know element by element right there and then you would get the result of a 3x3 so you can see right here right if you have a two by three matrix and you multiply uh a three by two matrix x and when you multiply that with uh two by three two and two would match right there right the resultant vector the final vector is this right here the the row of the first uh first matrix and the column of second matrix which is in this situation is going to be 3 by 3. so if this thing right here is 2 by 3 for example and multiply by 2 by 4 what you have is three by four matrix as a result sorted matrix another another way to do matrix multiplication which is this is a shorthand notation you can do this f symbol right here instead of writing this you can say x at y and you can see right there right it also give us the same result right here uh if you look at if you take a look at this cell right here you see that i have a three by two and i multiply it with a three by two right here right and when i do that um collab or python or numpy would give us an error saying that uh the size is different three is different from two right so you have to have this number uh it's either either gonna be two two or three three then that matrix multiplication would work otherwise if you have a side mismatch it's going to give us an error as you can see right here now that's another there's another way to multiply um uh in the numpy and you do this by element by element and the one requirement is that the shape has to be the same and the situation the separation is the same so x and z in this situation are both three by two and what we do in this type of multiplication is that multiply is that we multiply um element by element y so let's say for example if you look at 30 and 45 right here right or 30 30 and three okay so go back to the original matrix what you do is that element wise so you take first and first which is five and six right here which is 30 right there right and nine and five is 45 so right there right so 30 45 so you go element by element and you multiply that

together and just put the result well where the position is okay and you can see right here right if i try to do the multiply the element wise with different shape it will give us an error right here

now finally uh we can also do matrix multiplication using the pi torch library um so i can create a tensor uh three by two right here and you notice that in this this time right here right i'm using a random um a random generator so it's going to generate real number randomly right here okay and the first one is three by two the second one is two by three now in this situation right here i'm also going to create a random number but using numpy 2x3 the reason is because i want to show us that if you have one matrix defined as using numpy and the other matrix we find using pi torch python is flexible enough that it will let you multiply new matrix multiplication between two different types right here okay so you can see right here right the first one is that um doing the x and y matrix multiplication of the same type tensor right here and they give us this result right here okay and then this row right here is just going to round it to uh three digit um uh three digit one two and three right here so if you put two uh in this round right here um right here it's gonna route it to about 0.26 instead of 0.256 right here you know just this thing right here just making displays a little bit better and you can see right here right in

in the second calculation right here i'm taking x and i multiply which is type tensor and i multiply with i'm gonna do matrix multiplication with z once c sub one and then underscore one and you see that it has a type of numpy array and but the matrix multiplication still go true and the third example is that we can take the numpy convert it to a tensor and then give it a thai float right there right and then we do the multiplication of x and z underscore two x and z underscore two and of course both of these give us the same result right here so these are some examples of matrix multiplication in numpy and pi torch right here i hope that will help you understand it a little bit have a good day and i'll see you next time
