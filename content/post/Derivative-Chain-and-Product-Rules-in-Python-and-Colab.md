hi everyone in this video i'm gonna talk about the change and product rules uh in derivative now in my other video i also discussed about derivative but that applied to simple polynomial for example um x to the fifth power plus a constant there's no product there's no function embedded within the function or two polynomial multiply by multiplying each order so when you have embedded function within the function or the multiplication of two polynomials the derivative of those are a bit unintuitive and it can be challenging for your computer to work on them but fortunately new libraries in python like senpai can do these the rules accurately and efficiently so if you take a look at the notebook right here you see that the first thing i do is uh is to import the numpy library and the sim by library i also import the display iphone display so that it can displace the equation nicely so the change in product rules for derivative for multiple multiplication of function and embedded function the rules again where the rules are not intuitive but python libraries can do these accurately and efficiently so if you have if you have for example two function and you are adding together and you want to find the right derivative derivative of that then the resulting derivative is just the derivative of each of the function added together now if you have a product of two function that's a bit it's a bit different the result is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first one sometimes the derivative of the second function then if you have this is the product rule and here's the chain rule if you have the derivative of a function within the function then you just do the derivative of that function with respect to the embedded function first and then you multiply that with the derivative of the embed function with respect to x variable variable x right here so so to to create equation using simpli the first thing we need to do is we need to create a symbolic variable x right here and when we have a symbolic variable created we can create two functions and this one right here f of x is seven x to the third power minus five and g of x is three times x to the four minus four times x to the second power right here so this next step right here is i'm gonna print f and g um separately and then i'm going to and then i'm going to display uh f and g right here and the next step is that we're going to calculate using the diff of my method of the simpli library to calculate the derivative of f of x and the derivative of g sub x separately and i'm going to display the derivative of f of derivative of y right here

okay now one thing you want to notice that in the print statement i have an apostrophe right here right here and usually for a string in python you can have a double apostrophe or single apostrophe but if you have a single one inside ideas you're gonna need to use a double one outside so that you know that way it's not confusing then python will not give an error okay um and then here uh we're gonna do yeah we're gonna demonstrate that the product rule first using senpai and i said if you use the pi just feed them the argument the the two functions and multiply together like this it's going to calculate it's going to do its magic and calculate and despite the result for you at a crossroads you can also do the product group manually using the uh the product rule right here okay and this is what we did we take the reference the first one time the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function and here we display the result for both okay now you can see right here right here is f of g which is this and this right here and so the derivative of the first one is of course right uh 3 times 7 21 and to the second power the constant go out and this guy right here is 12 x to the third power minus 8ax so two times two times false a and two minus one is one right there okay and you can see right here right for the product rule uh using simpli or manually the result uh the results are the same right here okay and then finally

we can also see we can also see in the change rule example right here so if you have g sub g of x it is x to the fourth power minus five and then f of x is of course is uh you know this whole thing to the third power so here is a function embedded within the function f right here now here is the here is the g of x the g of f of x right here okay uh this guy right here the whole thing to the third power okay so g of f of x and then if you find the derivative of that just feed this equation into that and uh simply just do it automatically and give us this result right here you can see right here right so um so the um the the chain rule is 3 right times the derivative inside which is this right here and then you know time the derivative of the function g of x and sign which is 20 28 x cubed 28 times 3 is 84 right here so here's it here's the example of using simpli to calculate the derivative you know involving the chain rule or the product rule um if you find this video helpful i hope you find this video helpful if you've uh if you do uh please give it a like a thumb up give it a hug the comment and subscribe thank you and have a nice have a good day bye
