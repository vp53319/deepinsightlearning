hi everyone in this video i'm going to be talking about the mean the median and the variance now if you take a look at the collab notebook here well first of all we're going to import numpy as np so that we can use it in the notebook and you can see right here right mean in a way is is a number that try to measure the central tendency of the distribution it conveys information about the concentration or the center of the data distribution now it's more suitable for normal distribution normal distribution is basically you have a gaussian shape you know you have a mountain shape like this right here if you have like two mountain shaped like that yeah then that is not a normal distribution for example and the mean is not a good number to describe that distribution as you can see right here right the formula for the mean is that you add up all of the numbers in the distribution let's say for example you have a list of number right here right you add up all those number and you divide by the total number in the list and you get the mean and it's usually signified by the letter x bar you know the bar right here for me and by the way um i'm creating this cell right here using text the text right here right and if you double click on that right here i'm using latex um in between the the model symbol right here for example bar x right here right this thing right here um you know when you put it in here it can give you a nice represent representation of the formula um so let's say for example right here right if you want to find out how to write a formula for the mean just google latex mean function or something like that and it'll guide you to you know how to how to do that in the first few links okay so as an example for them for the mean i'm using the list right here of the velocity of planets going around the sun orbital velocity right here so like for example this right here is mercury venus mercury venus earth right here so earth is going around the sun about 30 kilometers per second which is actually pretty fast right there imagine if you go from our way to vegas with that speed right there now this function right here would get the number uh length of this list right here uh for example get the number of this list so it's one two three four five six seven eight nine so it's a planet plus pluto right here is pluto so when we have the the number in the list uh we can calculate the mean by two methods the first one is manual so you sum up all of the number in the list and you divide it by uh the total you number the number uh of element in the list which in this situation is nine and then another way to do that is uh you can just use the mean function in numpy so and uh let me say n p numpy dot mean um then um just do the give it up orbital velocity and we'll do the rest in here right so we we add up with this sum right here would add up all of the element in the list and divide by the total number of elements under that right here and this one right here we just calculate by giving it the list and you can see right here right the two methods give us essentially the same number and by the way this print format right here in python right you can specify it so that it prints out um the number of decimal you wanted for example right here right what does mean is that it's going to say take this number put it here and then just um round it up to two decimal uh uh to two decimal right here floating right here okay and then another method and the number that you can use median because sometimes you know the the distribution skills really y to one number instead of other imagine if you had jeff bezo in the list of you know 10 people you know with total well right you see that that mean right there it's going to be skewed really um in your way to the high side so in that situation right there you're going to want to do the median for example so if you do n pi median and you pass an orbital velocity it's going to essentially take the middle number so you look at this one right here right one two three four one one two three four all right so 13.1 is a middle number and the median is going to return us to us the middle number right here the next um topic i'm going to talk about is uh standard deviation and here is the formula for the standard deviation okay this one right here you can think of that as an unfinished version of the variant this is where his variant right that standard deviation gets the square root of the variance so we're talking about the variance right here variance measure the width or dispersion of the distribution and it's similar to standard deviation and it's suitable for a variety of distribution and this is a formula to calculate um the variance and again right i'm using latex and i'm using latex

and collab and you can see right here here's a formula for how to write this

how to write neatly the variance and the standard deviation you can just google that again right you know latex standard deviation latex variant i will show you how to do this right here okay and i'm creating the text cell for this okay so

now if you take a look at this right here right um this is the manual way to calculate the standard deviation using the formula and this dash line right here is basically you know for continuation because you see right here right my formula is uh is going to the next line right here and if you don't put this right here it can give you an error so if you want if you write have a continuation into the next line use this dash slide right here okay so this one right here is the manual way this one right here is a default numpy method to calculate variance at np the variance and you pass in the orbital velocity and then you know the variant method in numpy has another optional parameter a degree of freedom and you notice that this degree of freedom right here is zero okay so here and here you know when i run that you see that it gives us essentially the same thing so in numpy the degree of freedom is defaulted to zero but you know you can notice that if you calculate the um np manual you have a different number right here that's because the this definition right here is equivalent to the degree of freedom equal to 1 in in numpy right here so if you do for example if you do the the val method but with the degree of freedom parameter set equal to one and you see that it's essentially the same thing as the manual way that we calculate using this definition right here the reason why you had a minus one right here is because right we calculate the uh we calculate the mean already right here so we don't need you know so we don't if you put if you divide by n that would be biased because we already have this information right here right so in order to have unbiased version you're going to want to have n minus 1 to take into account that we already know know or calculate this mean right here okay so if you want if you want numpy to give us the similar result to this formula right here that you have to do the degree of freedom equal to one okay and finally does is there a practical difference if you have the degree of freedom equals to zero or degree of freedom equal to one right here so let's say right if you run for example if you run when n this one right here is a random integer between zero and 50 right and then you know there's 10 samples this time right there right you know that it's a smaller sample the variance can be um quite a part of the difference between degree of freedom one or zero if you go to five for example even just a thousand right there right it starts getting smaller and then you go to ten thousand uh or even a hundred thousand right there right um so there's practically no difference between the two method the two parameter one or zero in large number and you know usually working in statistics or in deep learning or machine learning uh the sample is usually pretty large right there right so you're gonna be okay in the real world so again right this is um you know this is the videos about the mean the median the variance and just an example of how to use that in numpy i hope this video helped if you liked it please give a thumb up give a hug subscribe and have a great day
